 I'm Matthew Charles Busel
 
 About Me
I'm a multi-disciplinary technologist driven by curiosity, bold ideas, and a deep belief in what software can become when fused with cutting-edge science. With a background rooted in Python, machine learning, and backend development, I specialize in turning speculative concepts into tangible code—whether it’s designing cognitive engines, quantum neural nets, or exploring bio-AI interfaces using mycelium.

My work spans across the frontier of AI/ML, quantum cognition, and computational biology, and I’m actively building tools, prototypes, and frameworks that challenge the limits of current hardware and software paradigms.
