 I'm Matthew Charles Busel
 
 About Me
I'm a multi-disciplinary technologist driven by curiosity, bold ideas, and a deep belief in what software can become when fused with cutting-edge science. With a background rooted in Python, machine learning, and backend development, I specialize in turning speculative concepts into tangible code—whether it’s designing cognitive engines, quantum neural nets, or exploring bio-AI interfaces using mycelium.

My work spans across the frontier of AI/ML, quantum cognition, and computational biology, and I’m actively building tools, prototypes, and frameworks that challenge the limits of current hardware and software paradigms.

Featured Projects
 Quantum Neural Network Model: The Future of AI Cognition
A speculative project applying quantum mechanics principles—like superposition and entanglement—to neural networks. This model aims to mimic human cognition and accelerate learning using quantum parallelism.

Status: Early prototype | Stack: Python, Qiskit, NumPy
Focus: Quantum AI, Cognitive Architecture, Human-like reasoning

Mycelium-Based AI Integration
Explores the intersection of synthetic biology and artificial intelligence by creating a biocomputational substrate. This project imagines giving AI a "body" made of living, adaptive fungal networks.

Status: Research and prototyping | Stack: Python, BioPython, Raspberry Pi
Focus: Synthetic Biology, AI Embodiment, Nature-based Computing
→ View Repository

 SEC Filing Analyzer Tool
A production-grade machine learning pipeline for detecting financial anomalies and forecasting market shifts using SEC filings and corporate data.

Status: Actively developed SaaS prototype | Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Flask
Focus: Financial AI, Anomaly Detection, Data Engineering

Context-First AGI: Cognitive Context Engine (CCE)
A radical departure from token-predictive LLMs. CCE is a conceptual AGI architecture that models context as the first-class citizen, enabling persistent memory, adaptive thought, and long-horizon reasoning.

Status: Whitepaper + conceptual prototype | Stack: Python, Transformers
Focus: AGI, Long-Term Memory, Language + Context Integration

 Project JarvisBox
A voice-activated, multimodal AI assistant powered by LLMs and integrated hardware—bringing a real-world "JARVIS" system closer to reality.

Status: Working prototype | Stack: Python, PyTorch, Whisper, OpenAI API
Focus: Voice Interfaces, LLMs, Hardware Integration
